## Features

### Common Parameters for All Mask Nodes
All mask nodes in this system share the following parameters:

- `Masks`: Input mask or sequence of masks to be processed. (you can pass in a blank mask if you want)
- `Strength`: Overall strength of the effect (0.0 to 1.0). Higher values usually intensify the mask operation.
- `Invert`: When enabled, the node performs operations on the inverse of the input mask.
- `Subtract Original`: Amount of the original mask to subtract from the result (0.0 to 1.0). Useful for creating edge effects or isolating changes.
- `Grow with Blur`: Expands the mask edges using a blur effect (0.0 to 10.0). Higher values create softer, more expanded edges. 

These parameters provide a consistent base for all mask operations, allowing for fine-tuned control over the mask processing across various node types. There are currently three categories of masks...

## Particle System Masks

Create dynamic, fluid-like effects through particle simulation:
- Supports N particle emitters, each with independent settings including movement, particle (spread, speed, size, COLOR, etc)
- Supports N force fields (Gravity Well (repel and attract), and Vortex), each with independent settings
- Each simulation space has basic gravity and wind settings
- Boundary-respecting particle behavior, where the particles try to respect the boundary of a mask
- Static bodies for particle interactions
- Spring joint settings for more complex particle behaviors
