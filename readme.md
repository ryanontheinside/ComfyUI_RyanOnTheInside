**Everything Reactivity**: Almost all nodes in this pack can be made to react to audio, MIDI, motion, time, color, depth, brightness, and **more**, allowing for incredibly dynamic and responsive workflows. If a node prefixed with  FLEX, then this reactivity is central to its functionality.**

- 💪 **Flex Features**: Dynamic control over IPAdapters, Masks, Images, Videos, Audio, and more
- 🎵 **Audio & MIDI Processing**: Separate instruments and create audio-reactive visuals
- 🎆 **Particle Systems**: Create mesmerizing, fluid-like effects
- 🌊 **Optical Flow**: Generate masks based on motion in videos
- 🌊 **DEPTH Flow** 🌊: Use flex features to control depthflow nodes, adding parallax animations to your workflows!
- 👤 **AdvancedLivePortrait** 👤: Use flex features to control facial animation expressions! 
- 🎨 **Advanced Controlnet** 🎨: Direct integration with ComfyUI-AdvancedControlnet!
- 🎭 **AnimateDiff** 🎭: Direct integration with ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved!





### 🚨 Important: Version 2.0 Update 🚨

This repository has been updated to Version 2.0! After careful consideration, I decided that a complete update was better than maintaining legacy support indefinitely. This new version brings significant improvements while maintaining all existing functionality. This update was done with user experience, extensibility, and functionality in mind.

### 🎉 What's New in V2
- **License**: This project is now licensed under the MIT License.
- **EVERYTHING reacts to EVERYTHING:** Now you can modulate ALL parameters of ALL Flex nodes! Possibilities increased by multiple orders of magnitude.
- **Optional Feature Inputs**: Feature inputs are now optional! This means these nodes double as a powerful suite for image, mask, and video manipulation even without reactivity! 
- **More Intuitive**: Redesigned with user experience in mind. Less noodles, more intuitive connections.

- **Help**: Takes full advantage of ComfyUI's tooltip system.
- **Manual Feature Creation**: New interface for drawing/creating features manually - far more powerful than it might seem!
- **Text as Features**: New integration with Open AI Whisper allows text to be used as a feature source, with a fully modular trigger system
- **Enhanced External Integration**: Deeper compatibility with external node packs
- **Image Improvements**: Major improvements to FlexImage nodes. One might say they are more than useful now.
- **Mask Improvements**: Major improvements to FlexMask nodes.
- **Performance Improvements**: Major performance improvements in many nodes. More to follow.
- **Feature Modulation**: More robust and feature-rich modulation system.
- **And much more!**


### ⚠️ Breaking Changes Notice
Due to ComfyUI's workflow loading mechanism, **existing workflows using these nodes ~~may~~ *will* break after updating**. I did consider this carefully, as I have yet to introduce breaking changes to this node system, but this extensive update  neccesitated a complete overhaul. There will not be a version 3. Rather, version 2 will be updated as needed. I have taken the time to update the most relevant example workflows to version 2.

If you need to run an older workflow, you can revert to the previous version of these nodes by using the Manager, or by running this command in your ComfyUI_RyanOnTheInside directory:

```bash
git checkout dab96492ac7d906368ac9c7a17cb0dbd670923d9
```

To return to the latest version later, use:
```bash
git checkout main
```
